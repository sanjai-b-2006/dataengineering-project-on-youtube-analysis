🎥 **Streamlining YouTube Data Management and Analytics** 🌐

I recently worked on a project aimed at securely managing and analyzing YouTube video data. The focus was on organizing and processing structured and semi-structured data related to video categories and trending metrics. Here’s what we achieved:

💡 **Key Objectives:**
- Created a process to ingest data from multiple sources.
- Built an ETL pipeline to transform raw data into a structured format.
- Used a centralized data lake for efficient storage and management.
- Designed the system to scale as data volume grows.
- Leveraged AWS for seamless cloud-based data processing.
- Developed interactive dashboards for reporting and insights.

🛠️ **Technologies and Tools:**
- Amazon S3 for secure, scalable storage.
- AWS Glue for building the ETL workflow.
- AWS Lambda for serverless computing.
- Amazon Athena for querying data directly in S3.
- Amazon QuickSight for data visualization.
- AWS IAM for secure access management.

📂 **Data Context:**
The project utilized a Kaggle dataset of daily trending YouTube video statistics across regions, including metrics like views, likes, comments, and video tags.

This project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of cloud-based data engineering and analytics. I'm excited to apply these learnings to future challenges.
